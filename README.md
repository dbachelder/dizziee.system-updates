# dizziee.system-updates

System update indicator for the Omarchy bar. Shows available updates from pacman, AUR, Flatpak, Omarchy, Omarchy shell plugins, and mise, with per-repo update buttons.

## Requirements

- `checkupdates` (from `pacman-contrib`)
- AUR helper (`yay`, `paru`, etc.) — optional, AUR detection is automatic
- `flatpak` — optional
- `mise` — optional, ships with Omarchy
- `git` — optional, for the Plugins row (git-managed shell plugins)

## Installation

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/JJDizz1L/dizziee.system-updates.git --enable
```

### Then place it in your bar layout with 
`omarchy bar plugin add dizziee.system-updates [--section <left|center|right>]`</br>

Suggested placement: 
```
omarchy bar plugin add dizziee.system-updates --section center
```

You can validate the plugin at any time with:

```sh
omarchy plugin validate ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/dizziee.system-updates
```

## Updating

To pull the latest version of the plugin:

```sh
omarchy plugin update dizziee.system-updates --yes
```

## Configuration
Configuration lives in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `refreshIntervalSec` | integer (300–7200) | 1800 | How often to check for updates (seconds) |
| `alwaysShow` | boolean | true | Keep icon visible even when no updates are available |

## How updates work

The **Arch** update button runs a direct pacman system upgrade:

```sh
sudo env OMARCHY_ALLOW_DIRECT_PACMAN=1 pacman -Syu
```

Omarchy installs a pacman hook (`omarchy-update-pacman-guard`) that aborts a bare `sudo pacman -Syu` to route updates through `omarchy update` — which handles the transcript, snapshot, keyrings, migrations, and post-update hooks. The `OMARCHY_ALLOW_DIRECT_PACMAN=1` env var opts this one transaction past that guard: it upgrades packages directly and skips Omarchy's update pipeline. For the full managed flow, run `omarchy update` instead.

AUR updates run through your helper (`yay -Sua` / `paru -Sua`), Flatpak through `flatpak update`, and mise through `mise up`.

The **Omarchy** update button opens your terminal and runs `omarchy update` — the full managed Omarchy update pipeline (transcript, snapshot, keyrings, migrations, and post-update hooks).

### Plugins

The **Plugins** row tracks the git-managed Omarchy shell plugins under `~/.config/omarchy/plugins`. For each one it fetches `origin` and counts how many commits `HEAD` is behind, mirroring what `omarchy-plugin-update` does. Its update button runs:

```sh
omarchy plugin update --yes
```

Only plugins that are git checkouts are considered; non-git plugins and plugins with no upstream are ignored. The row is hidden when no git-managed plugins are installed.

### mise

The **mise** row counts the tools configured in your global `~/.config/mise/config.toml`, so a stale `claude`, `codex`, or `opencode` pin shows up alongside your system packages. It mirrors what Omarchy's own `omarchy-update-mise` installs by dropping mise's release cooldown:

```sh
MISE_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE=0 mise up
```

The same override drives the count, so the number matches what that command will pull in. On mise builds that reject the override, the widget falls back to the plain `mise outdated --json` query instead of reporting a false "up to date".

### Event-driven refresh

After clicking **Update**, the widget watches the Hyprland event socket (`Quickshell.Hyprland`) for the updater terminal to close, then rescans once immediately — no blind polling. A slow fallback poll (10s intervals) only runs if window tracking is unavailable. Repo reachability checks are consolidated into a single process and skipped entirely when NetworkManager reports no connectivity.

## Package details

Click any repo row to expand it and list the packages with updates pending, with their version change. Each package links to its **release notes** when the upstream is a known code host (GitHub, GitLab, or Codeberg), and to its **repo/homepage** otherwise. Flatpak entries link to the Flathub app page, and rows with nothing pending are not expandable.

Links resolve offline from local package metadata (`expac -Q '%n|%u'`, falling back to `pacman -Qi`), Flathub app IDs, the mise registry, and each plugin's git remote (SSH remotes are rewritten to https) — no per-package network calls. The upstream URL map rides the same 24h disk cache as the package counts.
